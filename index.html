										<h3>3D Model Editor</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/OpenGLProjectIcon.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>Another first year assignment which was to create a game/program within OpenGL. I wanted to attempt something a little unique so decided on programing a 3D editor. The editor has the ability to move vertices of an imported model/mesh but also export models for use in other programs. <a href = "https://youtu.be/7_ygER0NRfg" target = "_blank">Video showcase</a></p>

										<h3>Mario</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/MarioIcon.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>This is my first year assignment to re-create Mario in SDL2 using C++. I created a level editor alongside the game to easily create new levels which I used to re-create the first orignial level from Super Mario Bros 3 with a few slight changes. The game has a few ai characters implemented just needs a few more adding to make it closer to the original game. <a href = "https://youtu.be/2LrED_N0Zh8" target = "_blank">Video showcase</a></p>

										<h3>Procedural Generation</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/ProcGenIcon.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>I love procedural generation and creating worlds/meshes that are created through code. This is a UE4 project, I started and currently working on optimizing the procedural generation before going onto creating a game on top of this prototype. I use perlin noise to generatate the world and biomes. The biomes are influenced by more perlin noise which represent temperature, moisture, and height. <a href="https://youtu.be/2tHjmVsfGzs" target="_blank">Early demo showcase</a></p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Skyrimn't</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/SkyrimntIcon.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>This was a game created for a jam hosted by Staffordshire University and judged by employees of Codemasters and Playground Games. I was the only programmer for this project working in UE4. Avaliable at <a href="https://hacchacc.itch.io/skyrimnt" target="_blank">Itch.io Page</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/auOVwwTJGKk" target="_blank">Video Showcase</a></p>

										<h3>YA3WWOG</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/YA3WWOGIcon.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>UKIE Game Jam 2020 entry. Working in a team of 5 I programmed the 3C's and projectile mechanics for the game but also involved with bug fixing of puzzle mechanics and UI within Unity. Avaliable at <a href="https://hacchacc.itch.io/ya3wwog-yet-another-3-wizards-with-orbs-game-bethesdnt" target="_blank">Itch.io Page</a></p>

										<h3>Rust Plugins</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/RustBattleFieldPlugin.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>I have been creating plugins for the game Rust since 2018, mostly personal learning projects but currently working on a large scale battlefield mod with a custom map. Source code will be avaliable on GitHub or uMod soon.</p>

										<h2>About Me</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										I'm a game programmer from the United Kingdom (born in Latvia). Currently studying at Staffordshire University. I studied game development at Loughborough College which gave me good understanding of the game industy and certain industy workflows. I love learning and working on procedurally generated content and enjoy working on personal projects like modding Rust but also making my own games in UE4 and Unity as well as participating in game jams.
